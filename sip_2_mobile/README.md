"*Dart/Flutter application capable of a PGP signing a text message of the arbitrary length and extend previously created web application mocking the logic to propagate and verify signed message.*" [here](https://github.com/KiraCore/docs/blob/master/spec/kira-signer/sip_2.md) 

**Warning:** This is build using Flutter SDK, which is fairly new and hasn't achieved full web support yet, however we are still adapting it and make it very useful.

Mobile implementation for scanning & generating bar-code and signing the data with a private key. This supports both android and IOS, requests permissions, and no need for specifying anything on Android (minimum support e.g.)
